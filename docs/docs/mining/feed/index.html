										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cointaft is a Proof of Work (POW) blockchain which uses the Ghostrider algorithm. Ghostrider was explicitly created for Cointaft, and is designed to keep speciality hardware such as ASICs or FPGA off the Cointaft network.</p>
<p>CPU mining is still the most efficient way to mine Cointaft, but GPUs can also be used. GPU mining however, is not as efficient as CPU mining.</p>
<p><strong>Mining Software</strong><br />
Wyvern CPU Miner<br />
XMRig CPU Miner<br />
XMRig CC CPU Miner<br />
WildRig GPU Miner<br />
ARM Mining<br />
You can mine Cointaft on ARM devices using Wyvern Miner, as well as XMRig. Both have to be compiled for ARM platforms, and work best on ARMv8. This is experimental and not officially supported. Mining on mobile phones is not advisable due to potential dangers involving lithium batteries and overheating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cointaft Pools</strong><br />
You can see a list of Cointaft mining pools on Mining Pool Stats. https://miningpoolstats.stream/cointaft</p>
